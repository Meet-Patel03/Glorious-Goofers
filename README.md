## 🌟 Overview
FocusFlow is a **real-time productivity tracker** that monitors your screentime across all applications, classifies your activity as **Productive, Neutral, or Non-Productive**, and provides **intelligent reminders and warnings** to keep you on track.  

At the end of each focus session, FocusFlow generates a **session summary report** — showing how much of your time was spent productively, along with detailed percentages.  

Whether you’re a student, developer, or professional — FocusFlow helps you stay in control of your digital habits and maximize your deep work sessions.
